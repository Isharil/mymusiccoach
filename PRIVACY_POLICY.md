- Your username (display name only)
- Practice sessions and exercise history
- Personal goals
- Schedule and settings preferences

MyMusicCoach **does not share any data** with third parties. No data leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to:

- **Export your data** using the built-in export feature (generates a local file)
- **Share session summaries** using your device's native share functionality

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device. MyMusicCoach does not use:

- Remote servers or cloud storage
- Analytics or tracking services
- Advertising SDKs
- Third-party login services
- Cookies or web tracking

## Data Deletion

You can delete all your data at any time from within the application by using the **"Reset application"** option in Settings. Uninstalling the application will also remove all stored data.

## Notifications

If you enable practice reminders, notifications are handled locally on your device. No notification data is sent to external servers.

## Children's Privacy

MyMusicCoach does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since all data is stored locally on the device and no data is transmitted to any server, the application is safe for users of all ages.
